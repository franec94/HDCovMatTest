Title: Test of high-dimensional covariance matrices with longitudinal data

Description: An implementation for testing the homogeneity of covariance matrices
    in high-dimensional longitudinal data with temporospatial dependence. The 
    null hypothesis is that all covariance matrices are equal at each time point.
    If the null hypothesis is rejected, estimates of the change points are 
    provided. A binary segmentation approach is applied to estimate multiple
    change points.
